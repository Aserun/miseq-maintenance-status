# MiSeq maintenance status
> Provides an overview over the current maintenance status of an Illumina MiSeq sequencer

There are several steps which should be don in-between two Illumina MiSeq sequencing runs.
Those steps reduce run carryover contamination and increase stability of the OS.
The goal of this GUI is to give the MiSeq users a quick overview what has already
been done and what still needs to be done before the next sequencing run.
